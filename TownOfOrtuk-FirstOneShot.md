One Shot Adventure Lvl 1ish
===========================

3-5 level 1ish adventurers
Run time 0.5 - 1.5 hours
You can add interesting stuff after the final battle, we were introducing people to DnD so I
abbreviated it.

The characters are in a small farming town near the Moonsea called Ortuk.

Ortuk is an old Elven settlement bordering the lake and a forest, primarily surrounded by high
dry-grass fields. There are crumbling pillars of old stone covered in moss on the western
faces throughout the fields where old elven constructs have long-since fallen or been scrapped for
building material.

The town lies south of the densest of these congregations of stones, and is comprised of dirt paths
stretching out into the fields where tilled earth supports various subsistence crops. Farmers work
these fields from early in the morning til dusk, and continual braying can be heard from the
donkeys used to cart water up from the lakeside for irrigation. The river coming from the forest
used to serve this purpose but very recently it suddenly ran dry.

One larger building in the center of the town is the inn, general store, and town gathering place.
Its wooden walls creak and whistle in the cold wind running across the lake from the south-west.

You are all in this tavern, having purchased small and simple but well-made meals, resting your
tired feet. To the north and west around the Moonsea the city of Phlan promises work, adventure,
and excitement for those of you who have been making the long journey there. Others of you have
come in from the massive forest to the north fresh off hunting or exploring. None of you expect
much from this little village aside from an adequate hay-bed and a roof overhead.

If the players strike up conversation, it's all about the forest and the river running dry.
These are superstitious folk who believe the spirits in the forest have grown angry for some
reason or another - some think it's a lack of religion in the town, others that passing traders
and adventurers who wandered into the forest have damaged or otherwise disturbed the spirits.

Breta - anti adventurer, DC 10 charisma to talk
Karl - anti adventurer, same
Ingrid - religious
Ferrick - religious
Innkeeper Finn

The four remaining might be stoked to an argument which breaks into a fight which the innkeeper
gruffly tries to abate. Maybe things aren't quite so idyllic in this farming village. (NOT combat).

It's an hour or so after dusk. Farmers in the inn have finished their cheap drinks and are slowly
filtering out to their homes before true darkness sets in.

You're all staying in one of a few large rooms on the ground floor where thin straw mats separate
you from the splintery wooden floor. You can hear rats or some other unsavory critters scampering
around below the boards.

Highest passive perception wakes to the faint sound of children laughing outside, soft but carried
into the building by the persistent wind. Investigating leads to the fields, where laughter can be
heard, and the tall grasses can be seen rustling, but no children are found if further searched.

The characters wake early in the morning to a woman screaming about her son. Her cries and the
gathering townsfolk reveal that her son went missing without a trace aside from a circular braid of
the tall wheatgrass, the same that surrounds the town, found inside the window by the boy's bed.

Additional shouts fly up from the town as similar discoveries are made in household after household.

In all, there are nine braided wreaths, and nine missing children - all between age 6 and 12 save
one, Zant, who is 15.

Mern
Carla
Strom
Bernerd
Ann
Mabrok
Renre
Leilan
Zant

When brought together, the nine braids wither rapidly, turning a deep purple-black.

The townsfolk are freaking out, running around searching and calling out the names of the
children. The innkeeper invites any traveling adventurers to search the forest - no locals are
willing to go in there, many thinking any spirits must now truly be enraged, others simply too
superstitious - if they search in there, more than likely they'll never come back!

Will you answer the Innkeeper's call?

Entering the forest, the trees and plants are splotched with purple as if a passing cloud of
noxious poison has stuck to them, marking a ragged path deeper into the foliage.

Some purple drips down onto a small spider on the forest floor, and it rapidly increases in size
and leaps at you!

Giant Spider fight
Add poison to spider's bite for stronger parties

Finding a clearing, dark purple fog obscures the partial sunlight filtering through the canopy.
An older boy stands at the head of two rows of four children facing one another. All their eyes are
glowing purple and they're all chanting in an unknown language. Two concentrations of purple fog
coalesce at the edge of the clearing behind the older boy.

A symbol is etched into the dirt in the center of the clearing pulses purple.
A DC 14 Arcana check informs that this is the symbol of Shar, goddess of darkness and loss.

Attempting to interact with the children is fruitless, entering the circle deals 1d4 magic damage
and throws the player out of the circle.

Hiding in the purple fog are two Cursed Dryads. Stats of a Dryad, but glowing with cursed light.
Add other features/effects of the curse of Shar for stronger parties or for fun.

Dryad fight (x2)
Add extra necrotic damage to Dryad hits for stronger parties.

When defeated, the purple fog clears. The children are freed from the magic and the marking on the
ground vanishes.

Bringing the children back to town goes without a hitch, and the town is overjoyed at the children's
return. They make you a feast to celebrate, and all is well again.. for now.
