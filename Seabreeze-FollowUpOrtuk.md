Follow-up for Ortuk: City of Seabreeze
======================================

After leaving the village of Ortuk, you travel with your newfound friends and allies, continuing up
and around the coast of the Moonsea toward the city of Phlan.

As you walk, afternoon turns to evening, and the dirt road slowly turns to patchwork cobble. You
are approaching the larger town of Seabreeze, named for the cold winds that whip through it off the
massive lake.

A low wooden wall surrounds the town, dotted with the occasional and irregular guard tower. A lone
guard standing by the entrance wearily eyes you as you pass through the opening in the wall
through which the road passes.
"Stay outta trouble, you.." she says, before softening slightly "Welcome to Seabreeze."

Uta - Guard, mid thirties
Chain mail, small shield, short sword

As you continue into the town, the guard says "Wait! 'S a road tax. Tax for the road, y'see. One
gold from each a ya" and extends an open palm.

DC 16 Intimidation, Persuasion, or similar evades the tax. Upon failure the guard draws her sword
and you're surprised by how deftly she weilds it. Her earlier weariness fades slightly and you
realize you cannot take her in a fight. "'S two gold each now!"

Paying her, or a DC 18 check for persuasion, placates her. Refuse, and you're driven
out of town and must find an alternate entrance. Perhaps camp outdoors until the
guards change.

The irregular shapes of wooden buildings characterize the town as far from wealthy, but it isn't
ramshackle. The cobble road passes east to west, bisecting the town.

The town is primarily houses toward the edges, then shops and larger homes can be found nearer the
center. Children run through the streets chasing one another and laughing. The people seem content,
if quiet.

People are eyeing your bunch as you walk through town.

15 Passive Perception, or highest passive perception with a DC 15 Perception check, notice people
speaking in hushes tones and glancing at others.

Closer to the center of town, 17 passive perception or highest w/DC 17 Perception notices a shadow
fleeting through an alleyway. Investigation reveals nothing but a sack of moldy potatoes.
If handled, a potato squishes, releasing a wad of small worms.

In the center of town, the cobble road meets with a river from the forest to the north. A large
stone bridge and stone clock tower in the town square hints at days of wealth from logging and
fishing long since past. You notice the clock tower has no hands.. has someone stolen them for
scrap metal?

As evening turns to dusk, you find your way to a bustling inn. People are sitting in close groups
chatting and looking around, although there isn't much in the way of laughter or music.

The innkeeper will rent you beds upstairs in the wooden building. You're served a reasonably well-
cooked stew and ale if you pay for it. The innkeeper doesn't say a word.

As night begins to fall, people filter upstairs or out into the encroaching darkness.

You're awoken by the sound of a cracked brass bell not so much pealing as ripping through the
morning air. A crier in the square is wailing "Torm's goodness upon you all, the new day ushers in
good fortune! Phlan has heeded our calls for help and have sent two knights of the holy order to root
out the deception in this town!"

Torm - deity of duty
Leira - deity of deception

The players can speak to the townsfolk, who they find reserved and quiet.

Lorin - cleaner than most, but wearing a somewhat ragged cloak over what appears to be reasonably
well-made clothing. He is out purchasing food, and is very skittish if interacted with.
If the players attempt to intimidate him for information, he shouts "please don't rob me!" and runs.

Sina - sweeping in front of the apothecary shop. She is an herbalist and will sell the players
potions of healing for 15 gold. She'll only talk about other customers, or a lack thereof, except
for a few people coming through buying this and that. "Do you know how hard it is to run an
apothecary shop when no one trusts anyone else?" If questioned about this, she says "What are you,
thick? Haven't you heard of the Breeze Bandit? They're sending some paladin types over from Phlan
just to have 'him caught!" If questioned about the bandit: "The Breeze Bandit is no mere thief, he's
a shadow! Nothing's safe, not even my herbs, and I live in the back of the shop! Best you hide anything
of worth yer carrying because no one knows who he is. Well, I guess *you* all
don't need to worry! HA!"

Other villagers, seeing either or both of these two interactions (with Lorin and Sina) will
actively avoid the players if approached.

Two gruff paladins exit the clock tower building and begin walking down the nearest row of houses
knocking on doors and speaking with inhabitants. They're both male, late thirties to early forties,
wearing gleaming half-plate. Each has a bastard sword at their waist and a shield across their back
emblazoned with the gauntlet symbol of Helm, the deity of Paladins.

Inside the clock tower the players are barred from further entry by two guards, who say "You don't
meet Mayor Yorick without an appointment!"
DC 12 Perception notices these guards are dressed nothing like the guard at the gate.

The players can now wander the town, where they'll meet untrusting citizens who eye them, ignore
them, and go about their business attending shops or sweeping the street.
Wandering town, passive perception 15 or a DC 15 check from highest perception notices another
fleeting shadow in an alleyway. Investigation yields little, but a DC 15 Investigation check
shows a dusty mark in the dirt of the alleyway, which a DC 16 History check reveals is the symbol
of Leira, the goddess of deception.

The paladins are going door to door questioning residents, growing increasingly frustrated at the
nonresposive citizens.

The players can attempt to speak to the Paladins, who will question them
* "How long have you been here?"
* "Have you heard of this bandit?"
* "Has anything of yours gone missing?"
* Angering them causes them to summon guards who throw you in a cell til the next day

Paladin
HP 25
AC 18
15+2, 13+1, 16+3, 12+1, 13+1, 12+1
Slash 2d8+2
Shield bash 1d8+2 DC 14 STR save or knocked prone and stunned
Healing hands (up to 15 points of healing to a willing target including self)
Multiattack

In combat, the players will lose. The first party member to 0hp ends the battle, and the paladins
resurrect that player and send them packing. "Consider yourself lucky, impeding our work is a sin
of high order."

If the players go to combat, they must nurse their wounds and pride at the inn, and if they're
thrown in jail, they aren't released until morning. Either case, skip ahead to the next morning.

If the players continue to wander town, the come across a heated argument between two townsfolk.

Bronn - male human, somewhat fine dress
Freda - female human, somewhat fine dress

Freda: "I know you took it! Don't you dare blame the Bandit!"
Bronn: "There's nothing else I can say! Search me, search my house, I didn't take your amulet!"
Freda: "Of course you'd say that. There are more places to hide things in your great ugly house
  than a goblin nest!"
Bronn: "How dare you! My house is a fine establishment. My family have been upstanding members of
  this town for generations!"
Freda: "Exactly why you think you can get away with theivery!"

Freda, noticing the adventurers, says "You all! Apprehend this man. He's stolen my family's amulet!"
Bronn turns to you all, afraid, "Please, don't get involved, I haven't done anything wrong!"

The players can end this debate, placating Freda.
The players can also call Bronn's bluff, and all will follow him to his large stone house in the
town square. He sits in the front room and Freda watches him while you are all given leave to
search his house. The butler will guide you around
* "Here are the portaits of members of the family"
* "Don't go in there! The dog hasn't been feeling well."

Combat: rabid dog
HP 10
AC 10
12+1, 14+2, 11+0, 5-3, 6-2, 8-1
Bite 1d6 DC 10 CON save against +2 poison damage
(The apothecary will heal rabidness for 5 gold, for anyone bitten)

* "This is the master's bedroom. Please do not touch anything."

The bedroom is in complete disarray, and a chest hangs open in the corner. Gold coins are
scattered around the room, drawers have been pulled out, but there's no sign of forced entry through
the balcony door. The butler reacts: "Oh dear! Oh dear. Don't move anything, I must fetch the
master." And scurries off.
DC 12 Perception gives more detail: It looks like the room was rapidly searched, and much was
stolen. A painting on the wall is missing, as are various pieces of finery, and the contents of
the chest, which appeared to mostly be gold.
DC 15 Investigation discovers a marking etched into the bedpost.
DC 10 Arcana or History recalls this as the symbol of Leira, the goddess of deception.
  unless the players succeeded the first recognition of the symbol, in which case no check is required

Freda and Bronn arrive and are both shocked. Freda exclaims "Convenient! If my amulet was here,
the Bandit will have taken it!" She turns to you "Well, if you find my amulet, please return it
to me. It's an old family heirloom. I live in the stone house with the blue door near the square.
The amulet has a light blue stone set in ornate silver." She departs.

Bronn is in shock, searching the room and placing the few scattered gold pieces back in the chest.
In all, he looks crushed. He has lost quite a lot.

"Find this Bandit, reclaim my gold, and I'll reward you greatly. Now, please leave, I have.."
sighs "I have this to attend to."

Entering the square, two other guards are walking together.
DC 8 Perception notices these guards also look nothing like the one at the gate in terms of
equipment and attire.

The paladins enter the inn and begin drinking heavily, complaining loudly about the townsfolk.
They're intimidating any citizens who attempt to intervene or even look at them too long.
One smashes a glass on the table and shouts "Another! I'll have another, and you all will pay for
it!" Gesturing with the remaining portion of the glass at the townsfolk.

A barback starts cleaning the glass on the table, and starts off with the pieces. The drunken
paladin says "Boy! Wait, boy! What was that look you gave me, eh?"
The barback is terrified and speechless, frozen in place until an armored hand slaps backward
across his face and he collapses. The bartender drags the boy off and sits him down behind the bar
before bringing more ale as the paladins demand.

Eventually the paladins stumble out of the establishment completely wasted. No one dares follow
them out, or move from their tables. The players hear drunken shouting outside and the drawing of
swords.

Outside, the players recognize Uta, the guard at the entrance, wielding two swords, a dark
purple cape trimmed in red now adorning her chain mail. A thin layer of purple light shines on
her swords. One paladin is on the ground with a huge rend in his armor across his chest. He's
clearly dead.

The other paladin is standing facing down Uta, sword drawn and shield up. His sword beings glowing
lightly with white-gold light, and the two clash together, blasts of light flurrying off in every
direction. They're trading blows, Uta denting the paladin's shield and clearly besting him.

The players can help either side at this point.
One of the following occurs:
If the players side with the paladin, the fight continues, Uta with the upper hand, until the
paladin dies. If the players gain an advantage in the fight, or once the paladin is dead, she
leaps back, her cape shimmers around her, says, "you fools. Do you even know what you're
protecting?" and flies up, disappearing into the night. If the paladin survives this fight, he
leaves town that night to report back to his order, after blessing the body of his comrade and
asking the townsfolk to bury him. The dead paladin cannot be resurrected, attempts fail in a shimmer
of dark purple.

If the players side with Uta, the paladin quickly dies. Uta says "Thank you for your help.
Some of what I've stolen is buried just outside town the way you came in, behind the large rock
north off the trail. You almost caught me coming back from there, I wasn't expecting travelers."
Then she laughs, her cape shimmers around her, and she flies off into the night, disappearing.

Once the battle is over, the townsfolk pour out of houses and out of the inn.
All they saw was you all run into battle, and then Uta fly off into the night. They hail you as
heroes. A finely dressed elder man says "Thank you for what you've done. You may stay in the inn
free of charge tonight, we will bury these/this valiant soldier/s of light, slain in battle. Tomorrow
morning we will reward you properly.

The following morning, the players can retrieve the treasure and be rewarded by the town.

+900 XP
+200 gold reward from Yorick for driving the Breeze Bandit out of town if the loot is returned.
+400 gold and no magic items if the loot is not returned.

If Bronn's fortune is returned, he gives the players one Boots of Elvenkind.
  Advantage to stealth checks, silent footsteps.

Freda, if the amulet is returned, gives the players another amulet: "This one isn't an heirloom,
  but I think it's useful for something."
  A DC 6 Arcana check tells the players it's an Amulet of Adaptation
    While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have
    advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill
    and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
    Requires attunement.
