Dewey Death-imal System
=======================

Three to five level 1-4 adventurers (balanced for lv 2)

The Wizard's Library of Melvaunt, a fancy keep near the city east of Phlan.

People come from far and wide to visit this beautiful stone keep, a dullish red with
high walls of stone and central spires reaching far toward the sun overhead.

Many are turned away at the gate for being relatively uninteresting people - the wizards of
Melvaunt are a snobbish bunch interested in only enough magic to keep themselves on the city's
payroll, and while tourism must be profitable, it seems they don't care to host many of the
travelers who come through.

You notice than none in fine dress or with jewelry are turned away.

As you approach, a multicolored explosion rips part of one of the spires apart and rubble flies
outward from the tower. After a moment the rubble stops dead in midair, and slowly accelerates back
toward the building which repairs itself, stone and dust flying back into place. The gatekeeper
doesn't so much as bat an eye.

The players can approach the gate, and must speak with the gatekeeper.
DC 15 Performance, DC 12 Deception or Persuasion allow entry, or 15 gold each.

The inn inside the grounds is a low, wooden building which can't be seen from outside the walls.
It's called the "Belching Balor" and has a horned skull breathing (or perhaps belching?) flames
ornately carved into the door.

Melvin - Rich, friendly traveler interested only in taking home the oldest book he can
possibly get his hands on - one of the following:
  "Obryth: First Demons of the Abyss"
  "Fyre Magicks"
  "Practical Herbology, 1st edition"
DC 14 Sleight of Hand can pickpocket him for 10 gold
He will try to follow the adventurers through the keep
  If he does, his armored guard will follow the party as well
  Archie
  HP 25
  AC 18 - full plate
  16+3 STR, 12+1 CON, 11+0 others
  Halberd sweep - multi-target 2d8+2

Melvin spots the adventurers and says "WELL now, you all look QUITE interesting! Tell me of your
travels! What are you drinking?"

Melvin then presents the adventurers with their quest.
"This place is a library. I'm looking to expand my collection while I'm here! I simply mustn't
leave until I've found a tome these wizards will part with! In fact, if you help me find what I'm
looking for, I'll give you each 80 gold! Yes! And a special reward as well, that's a secret for
now."

The next morning Melvin and his guard will be awaiting the players in the inn.
"Right-o, let's find us a book! Keep your eyes peeled for books for yourselves, eh? Well perhaps
not you, you don't seem particularly bookish, but perhaps you?"

"This is Archie, he's here in case I get into a spot of trouble on my travels. He's a quiet one!
Which is great! He's a great listener! Aren't you, Archie?" (Archie is motionless)

Wizards walk in twos and threes around the grounds, noses buried in books or chatting. They
entirely disregard the travelers, aside from the occasional "Have you been to the shop?
There are some quite fantastic magical trinkets to take home."

Light of various colors randomly illuminate windows up and down the central towers of the
Library, and occasional puffs of smoke or dust of various colors blasts out of them. The messes
each seem to magically clean themselves leaving the dull red stone clean and smooth.

Inside, they find a grand stone room with great spiral stairs in the middle, and wood-and-iron
doors evenly spaced around the circle.

Stairs to the basement - if the players descend these stairs, they find themselves descending back
to the ground floor where they started. They feel a magical whoosh as this occurs.

Stairs upward - if the players ascend these stairs, they suddenly find themselves on top of the
flat top of the tallest tower, a 30-ft circle with a force field around the edge extending upward
into the sky. The view is fantastic, they can see ships on the moonsea, fog over the Thar forest,
the mountains in the distance.
A small sign portrays drawing a circle on the force field with one's hands - this creates a zoom
effect in the force field allowing distant sight.

Descending the stairs places the players back on the ground floor.

The purpose of the enchanted stairs is to create an implication of many rooms in the tower
without having to define all of them. If the players ask a wizard about this, the wizard will
mumble something about the other rooms being restricted to tourists.

16 doors around the ground floor:
X - Rainbow-colors of dust blast out of the doorway dealing 2d6 force to whoever opened the door.
    Looking into the room all one can see is glowing lights floating in what seems to be shimmering
    light and color.
X - A wizard is standing in front of a pentagram, candles lit in each corner. She ushers you in,
    and you all feel yourselves pulled into the room. The door slams and the doorknob disappears behind you.
    "Wonderful! Wonderful, welcome. I need your help with something. She disappears into a burst
    of shadows, and a shadowy figure arises in the center of the pentagram.
    Pseudo-demon
      HP 32
      AC 15
      Firebolt +4 1d10 twice per turn
      If dealt more than 8 melee damage in a single player turn, a burst of flames pushes
      anyone in melee range back 10 feet and deals them 1d8+2
      Upon dying, explodes in a burst of flame with a loud belching noise, 1d6+1 to everyone
    The wizard re-appears.
    "Fantastic! Quite a bit of a blighter, wasn't he? I'm working on it for the inn. Don't you
    see? A mini-balor! That belches! Such fun!"
    The door behind you all swings open and you're thrown out of the room. The door then slams
    shut in front of you all.
X - The room has floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with books and scrolls. Searching the room doesn't
    reveal any of the ancient books Melvin wants to find, but it does anger one of the books, which
    jumps from the shelf and begins chomping and racing towards the party!
    HP 12 Weakness to fire
    AC 10
    Bite +5 1d6
X - A lone duck stands in an otherwise empty room. It's extremely cute, and quacks meekly when
    you all open the door. Taking the duck with you gives unexplained advantage to skill rolls.
    This is a reference to munchkins, "duck of doom."
X - Three forlorn ducklings are waddling around the room, bumping into walls
    If the duck has been brought, the duck races to the ducklings and quacks happily.
    The duck then shoves its empty nest toward the players, in which they find a lustrous pearl.
    DC 10 Arcana or asking a wizard identifies the pearl as a Lesser Pearl of the Sirens
    which allows its user to breath underwater and swim at half their speed, after attunement.
X - Swirling glowing ghosts swarm the room, illuminated by a glowing green diamond-cut gem
    floating in the middle of the room. They seem to be orbiting it. Two wizards stand in the
    room, their hands glowing the same green as the gem. Upon seeing the characters, one shouts
    "SHUT THE DOOR!"
    For every few seconds the door remains open, a ghost slips away from the pack and exits the
    room, causing havoc as it swirls around the large room, before zipping upward through the stone
    ceiling.
    If more than 5 ghosts escape, the wizards grow furious, the door slams shut and the ghosts
    disappear as all glowing stops. The two wizards then cast a spell on the crystal, which
    becomes engulfed in clay which appears from nowhere. The two wizards disappear, and the players
    must battle this clay golem
    HP 38
    AC 10
    Punch +6 2d8+2
    Water might blast away the clay which slowly reappears, but if the gem can be seized
    (DC 14 Athletics + DC 12 Sleight of Hand) the golem melts and the clay soaks into the floor.
    Failing either roll means the player is stuck in the clay and must lose their next turn
    making a DC 8 STR check to escape.
    The gem seems normal after defeat, although can probably be sold back to some other wizards. 
X - Two tall (6ft) staffs with orbs at the top, wielding (somehow?) tiny, immobile wizards
    with pointy hats, are waving these wizard-wands at one another, spells flying back and forth and
    being blocked. Defeating the staffs frees the wizards, who return to normal size and thank
    the players, giving each a potion of healing (2d4+2).
    Magic Staff (?) x2
    HP 10
    AC 14
    3x +4 2d4+1 force
X - Another library. Searching the room reveals "Practical Herbology" but further inspection
    reveals that it is a 2nd edition
X - A lovely garden. The room appears to be entirely outside, but walking to the edge reveals a
    physical wall still exists, which becomes visible while touched.
    Tiny fey are flying from plant to plant, sprinkling magically-created water from their hands.
    Stepping on a plant leads to swift retribution from a nearby fey, 1d4+2 damage cast as a spell.
    Destroying anything leads to a battle
    Tiny Fey x6
    HP 8
    AC 18
    Attack as a swarm of tiny magic missiles +6 1d4 from each
X - Assign each player a number. Each player then rolls 1 dice (the next highest dice over the number
     of players). Rolling higher than the number of players yields no effect. Rolling the number
     assigned to a player transforms that character into the player with the assigned number
     until the players leave the room.
X - Each player rolls 1d4
    4: no effect
    3: every time this player attacks, they must involuntarily "moo" like a cow
    2: every time this player attacks, they must involuntarily "cluck" like a chicken
    1: every time this player attacks, they must involuntarily "croak" like a frog
      if they do not, they take 1/4 damage of their attack
    Two willing characters can touch to exchange these effects, including those
    with no effect
X - The players can hear somewhat muffled voices, of a few people talking - perhaps four?
    "We must levy a new tax for armor and weapons. Orcs and Zhents are gathering in the north."
    "Orcs? What evidence do you have of that? No scout has seen an orc in months."
    "Well, Zhents at least, and where those untrustworthy rogues gather, lower creatures aren't
    far off."
    "The Cult of the Dragon, too, no less, has been growing in strength and influence.
    They're always up to no good, and this time it's serious."
    "You don't really think they could do it, do you? Summon Her?"
    "Of course not. They're no threat to Phlan."
    Then the voices go silent.
    This room is designed to spy on the Phlan council room.
X - A font with crystal clear, perfectly still water sits in the middle of the room.
    Carved into the rim is "Speak a name, to seek, to find, to see"
    A note is attached to the edge which reads:
    "Cross-planar use may lead to unintended side effects. No children."
    It's a scrying pool. Design comedic effects if misused.
X - The players find a fountain glowing in soft light. Drinking from the fountain heals the
    players entirely.
X - The players are sucked into an entirely dark room. The air smells of sulphur and brimstone.
    Suddenly, an eight-foot tall duck appears, igniting in flames. It's holding a flaming whip in a wing.
    It has large horns and small wings, although doesn't appear to be able to fly. The area is
    illuminated by the flames, and you do not seem to be in a room - you appear to be
    deep underground.
    Lesser Demon Duck
    HP 40 immunity to fire and necrotic
    AC 11
    Whip +4 2d8
    Breath fire +4 2d6 multi-target
    Firebolt +5 1d10
    (2 slots) Misty step
    After it dies, regular daylight fills the room, and the players can find the exit
X - The tower has decided to be friendly for once, and shows you a final small room full of
    books. Sitting on a central pedestal is (1d4 for which of the three books, re-roll 1).
    If the players are too suspicious, Melvin (if present) rushes in to get it,
    suffering no consequence.

Melvin is overjoyed to have a new book, and gingerly takes it. Archie doles out bags of gold.
Melvin thanks the players and rides off with Archie.

If the players inquire about the special surprise reward, Melvin exclaims "Yes! I almost forgot!"
and hugs each player (previous sessions in this series have yielded more magic
items than is normal, so none today).

Upon exiting the tower, the players find themselves transported to the magical trinkets shop.
They must proceed through the shop to leave the area, any other exit simply teleports them to the
shop entrance.
