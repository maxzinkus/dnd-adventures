D&D 5e Adventures
=================

**NOTE: DO NOT READ THESE if you want to be a character player for any of them.
These notes are for the GM and contain complete spoilers and meta-narrative.**

Random adventures I've written to GM. They are free for use and distribution per the
Creative Commons license included. Enjoy, modify, make suggestions, etc!

Also, the license only applies to files I created. At the moment that is every file in this directory except:
* faerun_map.jpg
* EB Bauman Monster Index.pdf

And the `dice` codebase has its own license.
